Setting up Git repository in C:\MathnScience\ComputerScience20\00Coding\HTML-CSS dir
=====================================================================================

To create a repository:
	1. Create an empty folder or switch to the folder that you want to make a repository
	2. In the terminal window, give init command: git init >> to initialize the folder as git repository


The trunk or main branch tends to follow a stylized directory structure, but sometimes other shapes are present.
	zurg/trunk/src # source code
	zurg/trunk/doc # documentation
	zurg/trunk/tests # tests

A README file containing a description of the project/dir should be created.

As changes are made, the README file gets filled in with details about design choices, installation instructions, notable files and their contents, etc. For example, we might begin with:

Files
	README 	this file
	tests 	testing files, in pairs of *.in, *.expected
================================================================

HTMP-CSS practice files project
===============================

This directory contains HTML scafold, test index.html and other practice files. Here are more details:
